        <h2>Joe Kopera, CPG</h2>
        <p>I’m a GIS analyst + cartographer, front-end developer, and geologist who specializes in using Drupal, Leaflet.js, and associated libraries to build websites and interactive maps for clients.</p>

        <p>Formerly, I worked as the associate State Geologist, lead bedrock geologic mapper, and lead GIS cartographer at the <a href="https://mgs.geo.umass.edu">Massachusetts Geological Survey</a> from 2003 - 2016.  While there I primarily created geologic maps of various areas in Massachusetts: from boots-on-the-ground fieldwork to final cartographic production in a fast-paced, grant-driven, deadline-based environment. I also became the ad-hoc webmaster and information officer for the Survey.</p>

        <p>Below is a short portfolio of my recent and ongoing webmap and front-end development work:</p>

          <h3>NECSC Project Database</h3>
          <p>The DOI’s <a href="https://necsc.umass.edu">Northeast Climate Science Center</a> was looking to create a robust interactive map of the 100+ projects they manage across the Northeast. The primary goals of this map are to have the data source be a linked database that non-GIS savvy staff could update, with a simple, yet dynamic end-user interface including comprehensive filtering and search functionality.</p>

          <p>A key cartographic challenge in designing this map was that many of their projects share the same geographic footprint. This would create a map with dozens of identical, overlapping polygons.  Given project constraints, I decided on using <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster">Leaflet.MarkerCluster</a> to display the centerpoints of the polygonal footprint of each project, with the polygon only being displayed for a selected, individual, project.</p>

          <p>Note: This map is still under active development, and awaiting content, and design input, from the client. It will contain over 100 individual features, additional filters, content, etc… </p>

          <h3>Evolution of Glacial Lake Hitchcock</h3>
          <p>Glacial Lake Hitchcock was one of dozens of lakes in New England along the southern edge of the ice sheet that covered much of North America at the end of the last Ice Age. These lakes were ephemeral and formed by runoff from the glacier as it melted and retreated northward in response to a warming climate.</p>

          <p>For some time I had been wanting to create a more accurate visualization of the Lake, as most existing maps of it tend to exaggerate its extent.  This is partly due to their omitting the ice sheet, but primarily because such maps are created using DEMs of present-day topography, which don’t account for the weight of over a mile-thick layer of ice depressing earth’s crust into the mantle: as a result of this weight, southern New England’s topography at the end of the last ice age was several hundred feet below its present day elevation, before the crust rebounded from the weight of the ice. This dramatically affects the shape of the Lake when we try to reconstruct its extent in GIS using present-day digital elevation models.</p>

          <p>Working with data from geologist colleagues and geologic maps, I modified DEMs of southern New England to create a model of regional topography at the end of the last ice age, and calculated the extent of the lake in QGIS using the resultant DEM and geologic records of the Lake's depth over time. With this, I was able to create snapshots of the Lake over time as the glacier retreated. The Lake in these snapshots closely matches the geologic maps of the sedimentary deposits it left behind.</p>

          <p>This map was created for the great folks at <a href="http://www.digitalgizmo.com/">Digital Gizmo</a> to be used as part of a <a href="http://dinotrackdiscovery.org/">larger educational website</a> on 19th century earth science, hosted by <a href="http://deerfield-ma.org/">Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association</a>.</p>

          <h3>Geologic Maps</h3>
          <p>Most of my time at <a href="https://mgs.geo.umass.edu">Massachusetts Geological Survey</a> was spent re-mapping large portions of the bedrock geology of the I-495 corridor in eastern Massachusetts and digitizing older, paper geologic maps using ArcGIS. These are highly technical documents produced primarily for other geologists in paper form, although in recent years several geologic mappers, including myself, have been pushing to make them <a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70188866">more accessible, interactive, and modern</a>. I was responsible for the publication of over 22 individual maps in my 13 years at the Survey.</p>

          <p>For most of these maps, I performed the data collection, interpretation, and final cartography.  Data collection consisted of 90 - 120 days of fieldwork for a 55 square-mile area defined by a 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle. This effort was usually spread out over several years.</p>

          <p>The cartography for such maps is <a href="https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/standards/NCGMP09/">fairly standardized</a> and primarily based on using ArcGIS for the production of paper maps as the end product, although in recent years the creation of accompanying GIS databases has also been a focus.</p>

          <p>This map portrays the bedrock geology of the area surrounding Hudson, Massachusetts, and was the most recent map I published with the Survey.</p>
